# Heart Disease Prediction using ML Classification Models 🚀

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease in patients using **Machine Learning** classification models. By analyzing patient data, this model helps in identifying individuals at risk, enabling early intervention and treatment.

## 🔥 Key Features
- **Data Loading:** Loads heart disease dataset from a CSV file.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales the features.
- **Model Training:** Trains multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM).
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization:** Plots confusion matrices and classification reports.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** (Data Manipulation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data Visualization)
- **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning)
- **NumPy** (Numerical Operations)

## 📊 How It Works
1. Load the dataset (`heart.csv`).
2. Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Train multiple classification models to predict heart disease presence.
5. Evaluate and compare model performance.
6. Visualize the results using confusion matrices and other evaluation metrics.

## 🚀 Running the Notebook:
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook in your preferred environment (Anaconda, Jupyter Lab, etc.).
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the notebook by opening Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb.

## 📌 Example Output
- Confusion Matrix (visualizing model performance)
- Classification Report (precision, recall, F1-score for each class)
- ROC Curve (for model evaluation)
  
## 🎯 Future Improvements
- Add feature selection techniques for improved model performance.
- Implement Neural Networks for a more complex model.
- Develop a web-based application for real-time heart disease prediction.
